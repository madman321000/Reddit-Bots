You can't compare my boy to anyone...he's gonna be better than Steph Curry in the NBA./
We not even caring about Nike and Adidas and Under Armour. We not even competing with them, because we're better than them, we're a step above them. We're what you call a premium activewear./
A billion dollars, it has to be there. That's our number, a billion, straight out of the gate. And you don't even have to give it to me all up front. Give us $100 mil over 10 years./
Rookie of the Year? It's already a done deal, I got the trophy already...How could he not be?/
Lonzo Ball is gonna take the Lakers to the playoffs his first year./
To me, Zo is the best player in the world. ... I don't know if he can beat [LeBron James and Russell Westbrook] one-on-one, but I know he can beat them five-on-five./
Back in my heyday, I would kill Michael Jordan one-on-one./
I know I must be a genius to plan it this well./
If the game was 1-on-1, I'd be the champion of the world./
If you can't afford the ZO2s, you're not a big baller./
I've been coaching them all their lives. I've instilled something in them that you can't take out. Like, ï¿½No shot is a bad shot./
If Charles thought like me, maybe he'd win a championship./
These boys were born to go pro. Your mom's a P.E. teacher, I'm a personal trainer, your last name is Ball. How much more lined up can you be?/
You got LeBron, it's gonna be so hard for his kids, cause they gonna look at them like you gotta be just like your dad./
Realistically, you can't win no championship with three white guys because the foot speed is too slow./
Stay in yo' lane./
There's only two dudes better than me, and I'm both of them./
Lonzo's fittin' to step over Magic to be the best guard ever./
Whose team is it? Man, everybody know whose team it is - it's Lonzo Ball's team! LeBron's coming over here to join us. We ain't going over there to join him.
